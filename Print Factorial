Check sample input / output below for more clarity.

Input Format
There are multiple test files.

Each input test file contains only 1 integer 
N
N.

Output Format
For each test file, output only the integer which is Factorial of 
N
N.

You do not need to output anything else.

Sample 1:
Input      Output
5          120
Explanation:
Factorial of 5 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Python3:
# cook your dish here
num = int(input())
x = 1
while num > 0:
    x = x * num
    num -= 1
